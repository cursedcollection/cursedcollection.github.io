Here are the top 10 albums that captivated me this week.

### 1. The Ocean – Holocene

The Ocean is an extraordinary band with an amazing discography. While this particular album starts off with a bit mellower tone, it gradually built up momentum, captivating me completely. I've got addicted to this album very fast, and I personally think it's the band's third best work till date - right after Precambrian and Heliocentric.

This is the most underappreciated releases of this week in my opinion. This is a truly remarkable fusion of atmospheric sludge, funeral doom, and epic doom, creating a captivating mix of emotions encompassing sadness, happiness, and anger! This contains classical high-register doom vocals and also harsh vocals in a perfectly balanced manner. The atmosphere on this album is a top notch, imo. Rating this 2nd in the week list but could be in my year-end AOTY list as this is a slow grower.

    As I'm listening to this band's music for the first time, I find myself completely mesmerized by this album. It's an explosive compilation of technicality, sheer brutality, and breathtaking riffs. The vocal style displayed throughout the album is truly the standout element. Since this album has unquestionably captivated me, I'll definitely explore their previous works. Can't wait to unravel more of their briliant musicianship.

Gozu, an underappreciated band in the stoner psych rock realm, never fails to impress. If you are into Stoner/Psych/Heavy/Doom/Rock genres, their entire discography is an absolute must-listen. On this particular album, they have exceptional riffs that hit harder than their previous works. It's as if they've expertly crafted a flawless fusion of the distinct styles found in the works of Freedom Hawk, Wo Fat, and Khemmis.
