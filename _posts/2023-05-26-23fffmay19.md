The Ocean is an extraordinary band with an amazing discography. While this particular album starts off with a bit mellower tone, it gradually built up momentum, captivating me completely. I've got addicted to this album very fast, and I personally think it's the band's third best work till date - right after Precambrian and Heliocentric.
