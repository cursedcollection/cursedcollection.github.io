I stumbled upon this project through the "Similar artists" section on YouTube Music. Though I'm not an expert in DSBM (Depressive Suicidal Black Metal), I know a bit about its common traits. "Wo Trauer niemals endet" isn't groundbreaking, but it's a strong EP worth checking out if you're into the genre.

One thing I like about this album is its production. Unlike many DSBM artists with raw sounds, this one is cleaner, which I prefer. The guitar tuning reminds me of bands like Dark Funeral and late Nocturnal Depression, so if you're into them, you might like this too. The guitar riffs in "Death Addiction," "I Left This Life to Rot," and "Als all Licht meinen Lieb verlie√ü" are really good (I especially love the intros). The drumming, especially the blast beat at the start of "I Left This Life to Rot," is decent. The EP isn't long and doesn't have any filler songs, which makes even the conventional intro okay. The vocals, switching between evil screaming and melancholic whispers, suit the album's atmosphere well.

The only song I'm not sure about is "Todeslust." The vocals are only on the left channel, the guitar sounds a bit awkward, and the main riff isn't as catchy. But it doesn't ruin the album for me.

Overall, "Wo Trauer niemals endet" isn't perfect, and it might not be the best introduction to DSBM. But if you're already into the genre, you'll probably find some songs to enjoy. It's a solid album with good melodies and a melancholic vibe. Recommended for DSBM fans, especially those looking for lesser-known bands with good production.
